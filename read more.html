    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>I am a 34-year-old educator that is appointed by the SGB of <strong><em><a href="http://www.hs-uitsig.co.za/en/contact-us">Uitsig High School</a></em></strong>. I am a hard-working person that embrace life with great enthusiasm. I have a lot
      of passion for my calling as well as the subjects in which I received training. I believe that I will be of great value to any school and contribute positively to the lives of learners and colleagues alike.</p>
    <p>I matriculated in 2004 and started with my BEd degree at the <strong><em><a href="https://www.up.ac.za/">University of Pretoria</a></em></strong>. Unfortunately, I had to put my studies on hold at the end of my second year, I did however not
      give up on my goals and was given an opportunity to continue with my degree at the <strong><em><a href="https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default/">University of South Africa</a></em></strong> in 2012. I was offered an opportunity by the
      SGB of Amandasig Secondary School to teach Afrikaans in 2014, after which I graduated in 2015.</p>
    <p>I believe that Amandasig Secondary School and <strong><em><a href="http://www.hs-uitsig.co.za/en/contact-us">Uitsig High School</a></em></strong> respectively afforded me the opportunity to develop as a teacher and the person I am today. I do
      however have a lot more to offer and willing to spread my wings and avail myself to new experiences. I recently also started an online course on web development with <strong><em><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a></em></strong>.
